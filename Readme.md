## About

Chessie (Chess Inference Engine) is a command line interface tool designed to aid in the analysis of over-the-board chess games by using computer vision and machine learning algorithms to translate photos and videos of actual chess positions into official chess notation.

This tool is aimed at chess enthusiasts, players, and coaches who wish to analyze games or positions that are played in-person or in a traditional setting, without the use of digital boards or interfaces. With Chessie, users can take a photo or video of a physical chess board during a game or analyze an existing recording of a game, and have the program automatically translate the position into an official notation that can be used for analysis or further study.

At its core, Chessie leverages the power of computer vision and machine learning to accurately recognize the position of the chess pieces on the board, even in situations where the lighting or perspective may not be ideal. As the project is still in its early stages, users can expect frequent updates and improvements as the tool is refined and optimized.
